database : https://www.muratkoklu.com/datasets/ 'Durum Wheat Dataset' (bottom of the page)

This is an exploration of a Drum Wheat Database. I wanted a database containing data in a standard format as well as image to compare ML classification from text information, from images, and from videos. Data in file give a first approach to understand the classification, investigation on image will help to build keys functions, and finally findings will be used on videos to have near-real time classification

Right now only first (data exploration,  Classifier choice and optimization) using the excel file is present on github. 

However I still need try and implement a neuronal network (which are often used in image classification). Indeed in 2nd and 3rd parts I will try the vgg16 object detection and classification algorithm (a convolutional neural network), which is often use for transfer learning. ResNet50 algorithm will be tested too. And I also want to get a classification from 'classic' image information, such as red, blue and green values, hue, saturation, seed shape,.... i.e information that are in the excel file
